                         <p id="AO.DIR.340">There are three main railway lines in Angola: the Benguela railway, which runs from the coast to the Zambian border; the Luanda–Malange line; and the Moçãmedes line, which connects Namibe and Kuando Kubango. Following the end of the civil war in mid-2005 a project for rebuilding and upgrading the railway system was approved by the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The 424-km Luanda–Malange line was completed in mid-2010; passenger services resumed in January 2011 and goods transport (between Luanda and Dondo) in May 2013. The Benguela line—a significant export route—reopened in 2011, following demining and reconstruction work by Chinese workers. The Moçãmedes line was reopened in mid-2012.</p>

                    <p id="AO.DIR.367">Education is officially compulsory for eight years, between seven and 15 years of age, and is provided free of charge by the Government. Primary education begins at seven years of age and lasts for four years. Secondary education, beginning at the age of 11, lasts for up to six years, comprising two cycles of three years each. According to estimates by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), enrolment at pre-primary institutions in 2015/16 was equivalent to 39.6% of children (boys 41.8%; girls 37.3%) in the relevant age-group, while enrolment at primary schools in 2017/18 was equivalent to 88.5% of children in the relevant age-group. Secondary enrolment in 2015/16 was equivalent to 53.5% of children in the relevant age-group (boys 64.8%; girls 42.2%). According to UNESCO estimates, in 2023 spending on education represented 7.7% of total budgeted government expenditure.</p>
